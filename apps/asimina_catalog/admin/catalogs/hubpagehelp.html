		<p>
			For number of rows you want to show on your hub page, you have to provide number of familie images to be displayed in each row. This list will be entered as a comma separated value.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example we have 7 families in a catalog which means on the hub page of that catalog there will be 7 images/boxes to be displayed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Let's suppose we have to display 2 images in first row, 2 in second and 3 in last. So we will enter 2,2,3 where first 2 tells that first row will have 2 images/boxes. Second 2 tells second row will also have 2 images/boxes. 
			3 tells that third row will have maximum 3 images/boxes.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			For second case let's suppose we want to show 3 images in first row, 1 in middle row, 3 in last row. So we will enter 3,1,3

			<br>
			<br>
			So position of each number is the row number and that number itself is the number of images/boxes we have to display in that particular row
			<br>
			<br>
			Following are few examples
